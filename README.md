# Telegram Reports

A modular Python3 program made to send Telegram Reports.

## Installation

This repository uses [Telebot](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) to have a functional Telegram python bot.

```bash
$ pip3 install pyTelegramBotAPI
```
Then clone the repository and edit the following files on the base folder in order to customize it at your own taste.

keys.json
```json
"bot_key" = "YOURKEYGOESHERE" #Telegram bot API key
```

Then add your custom mods folders to the modules folder. Or try some of our official ones like [TomTicket_Reports](https://github.com/ErnestoMuniz/TomTicket_Reports) or [NPX_Reports](https://github.com/ErnestoMuniz/NPX_Reports)

## Usage

Run the bot with the following command:
```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

Then just send the commands on a chat with the bot and you're done.
